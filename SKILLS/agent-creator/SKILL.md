When to Use

Use this skill when the user wants to:

    Create new OpenCode agents (primary or subagent)
    Configure specialized AI assistants for specific tasks
    Set up agents with custom prompts, models, and tool access
    Define agent permissions and behaviors

Agent Types
Primary Agents

Main assistants you interact with directly. Users can cycle through them using Tab key or the switch_agent keybind.

Built-in examples:

    Build: Full development with all tools enabled
    Plan: Analysis and planning with restricted permissions

Subagents

Specialized assistants invoked by primary agents or manually via @mention. Used for specific tasks.

Built-in examples:

    General: Multi-step tasks with full tool access (except todo)
    Explore: Fast, read-only codebase exploration

Agent Structure

OpenCode agents can be defined in two ways:
1. Markdown Files (Recommended)

Create .md files in:

    Global: $MY_AGENTS/
    Per-project: .opencode/agents/

Format:
*.md

Define the agent's purpose, behavior, and guidelines.

Filename becomes agent name: code-reviewer.md → code-reviewer agent

Configuration Options
Required

    description: Brief description of agent's purpose and when to use it

Mode

    mode: "primary", "subagent", or "all" (default: "all")
        primary: User-facing agent, switchable via Tab
        subagent: Invoked by other agents or via @mention
        all: Can be used as both

Optional

    prompt: Custom system prompt (inline or {file:path})
    model: Override default model (format: provider/model-id)
    temperature: Control randomness (0.0-1.0)
        0.0-0.2: Focused/deterministic (code analysis)

        0.6-1.0: Creative (brainstorming)
    maxSteps: Maximum agentic iterations before text-only response
    disable: Set true to disable agent
    hidden: Hide subagent from @mention autocomplete (subagents only)

Tools

Control which tools are available:
*.yml
YAML
tools:
  write: true
  edit: false
  bash: false
  mymcp_*: false  # Wildcard to disable MCP server tools
Permissions

Control what actions require approval:
*.yml
YAML
permission:
  edit: ask          # ask, allow, or deny
  bash:
    "*": ask         # Default for all commands
    "git status": allow
    "git log*": allow
    "git push": ask
  webfetch: deny
  task:              # Which subagents can be invoked
    "*": deny
    "code-*": allow  # Allow code-prefixed subagents
    "reviewer": ask

Values: "allow" (no approval), "ask" (prompt user), "deny" (disable)
Provider-Specific Options

Any additional options pass through to the provider:
*.yml
YAML
reasoningEffort: high      # OpenAI reasoning models
textVerbosity: low         # OpenAI reasoning models

5. Validate approach
Best Practices

    Clear descriptions: Help users and agents understand when to invoke
    Appropriate mode: Choose primary for main work, subagent for specialized tasks
    Tool restrictions: Only enable tools the agent needs
    Permission granularity: Use ask for risky operations, allow for safe ones
    Temperature tuning: Lower for analytical tasks, higher for creative ones
    Prompt clarity: Be specific about agent's role and constraints
    File location:
        Global: General-purpose agents across projects
        Project: Project-specific workflows and conventions

Implementation Steps

When creating an agent:

    Determine scope:
        Primary agent for main workflows
        Subagent for specialized tasks

    Choose location:
        Global ($MY_AGENTS/) for reusable agents
        Project (.opencode/agents/) for project-specific agents

    Define configuration:
        Required: description, mode
        Optional: model, temperature, maxSteps, tools, permission

    Write system prompt:
        Clear role definition
        Specific guidelines and constraints
        Expected behaviors

    Test the agent:
        For primary: Switch to it with Tab
        For subagent: Invoke with @agent-name or let primary agents use it

    Refine:
        Adjust temperature based on output quality
        Fine-tune permissions based on usage
        Update prompt for better results

Usage
Primary Agents

    Press Tab to cycle through primary agents
    Or use configured switch_agent keybind

Subagents

    Automatic: Primary agents invoke based on descriptions
    Manual: @agent-name message to invoke directly
    Navigation: <Leader>+Right/Left to switch between parent/child sessions

Interactive Creation

Use the built-in command:
opencode agent create

This will:

    Ask for agent location (global/project)
    Request description
    Generate system prompt and identifier
    Let you select tools
    Create markdown file with configuration

Notes

    Markdown filename determines agent name
    Custom agents can work alongside built-in agents
    Agent changes require OpenCode restart
    Model format: provider/model-id (e.g., anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514)
    Hidden subagents (hidden: true) don't appear in autocomplete but can still be invoked programmatically
    Task permissions control which subagents an agent can invoke
